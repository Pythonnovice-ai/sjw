BASICS 26052020

Introduction to Python

Got to be in order, otherwise it wont print in order / answer the orders in the correct order


Variables:

'hello world' is a string
every type of number is numbers data
numbers could be strings 
'twenty' '20'  if it is written as a text format you cannot perform calculations
Boolean data is true and false


output (defining variables and strings, numbers)

person_name = "Mr Tom"
object_1 = "car"
object_1_colour = "red"
object_name_2 = "duplex"
object_2_age = "10 years old"

print("Hello, " + person_name)
print("I am very interested in your " + object_1 + " is it " + object_1_colour)
print("Also " + person_name + " is your " + object_name_2 + " older than " + object_2_age)
print("thank you " + person_name)

person_name = "Mr Wigglesworth"
object_1 = "bicycle"
object_1_colour = "silver"
object_name_2 = "apartment"
object_2_age = "10 years old"

print("Hello, " + person_name)
print("I am very interested in your " + object_1 + " is it " + object_1_colour)
print("Also " + person_name + " is your " + object_name_2 + " older than " + object_2_age)
print("thank you " + person_name)


Boolean 



having_house=True
if having_house:
    print("I own a small house")


having_house=False
if having_house:
    print("I own a small house")




String manipulation

print("I love pizza")
sentence="I love pizza and nachos" <--- this is the variable
print(sentence) 


Functions

sentence="I LOVE PIZZA AND NACHOS"
print(sentence.upper())

sentence="I LOVE PIZZA AND NACHOS"
print(sentence.lower())

sentence="I LOVE PIZZA AND NACHOS"
print(sentence.isupper())

sentence="I LOVE PIZZA AND NACHOS"
print(sentence.islower())



sentence="I lOvE pIzZa AnD NaChOs"
print(sentence.lower().islower()) <---- changing string to all lower case & checking it is all lower case by returning true or false 



sentence="I lOvE PiZza AnD NaChos"
print(len(sentence)) <------ app shows you the length of the sentence, here the output is 23 


Replace function
sentence="I lOvE PiZza AnD NaChos"
print(sentence.replace("PiZza", "SaUsAge"))  <------ ask python to replace one word with another 

Index function
sentence="I lOvE PiZza AnD NaChos"

print(sentence.index("P"))   <----- finds where P starts in the sentence 



sentence="I lOvE PiZza AnD NaChos"

print(sentence.index("AnD"))   <----- finds where AnD starts in the string, so in this case letter 13


print("I love pizza   \n and nachos   \n and tacos")   <---- this is simply splitting the string of text onto a seperate line underneath

Search on Google for the hundreds of easy functions that you can use 






8. DIFFERENT NUMBER MANIPULATIONS


Python respects the order of operations 
e.g. BODMAS brackets of division, multiplication, addition, subtraction


from math import*

print((((10+10)*3)/98)-20)  <------- answer in app is -19.387755102040817



from math import*

age=25+10

print("hello, my age is " + str(age))





from math import*



print(max(1, 5, 67, 2, 90, 4, 10))




from math import*



print(min(1, 5, -67, 2, 90, 4, 10))




from math import*



print(52/36+pow(5,2))





from math import*



print(round(52/36+pow(5,2)))   <----- asks python to print the rounded number (26), the complete number 


from math import*



print(abs(-round(52/36+pow(5,2))))  <----- gives you the absolute value of a number (-20 = 20) 

print(abs(-round(52/36+pow(5,2))))
print(sqrt(25))  <----- square root of 25



from math import*


print(ceil(23.99999))  <----- this function returns  24 


from math import*


print(ceil(23.0001))  <---- so does this !



from math import*


print(floor(23.99999999))   <------- this returns 23 




FACTORIALS


from math import*


print(factorial(3))  1*2*3  <----- returns factorial of 3 which is  6 



from math import*


print(factorial(100))   1*2*3*4*5*6 <----- returns the factorial of 100, which is a huge number and could bug your system so don't do it

9. INPUT FUNCTION 




age=input("what is your age?")


print("my age is" +age)   <------------------  this will return the variable 'what is your age?' you are then to input your age, e.g. 20, and then press return, this will then return 'my age is 20'in the app







name=input("what is your name?")


print("my name is" +name)


age=input("what is your age?")


print("my age is" +age)








name=input("what is your name?")
age=input("what is your age?")
food=input("what do you want to eat?")    <---- you answer these questions in the app below in python





name=input("what is your name?")
age=input("what is your age?")
food=input("what do you want to eat?")
drink=input("what do you want to drink?")


print("Hello, my name is " +name+ ", I am " +age+  ", I want to eat "  +food+", I want to drin/k " +drink)



name=input("what is your name?")
age=input("what is your age?")
food=input("what do you want to eat?")
drink=input("what do you want to drink?")
holiday=input("where do you want to go on holiday?")

print("Hello, my name is " +name+ ", I am " +age+  ", I want to eat "  +food+", I want to drink " +drink+ ", I want to go to " +holiday)




App for user to input price, quantity and calculate the final price

price_product_1=input("what is the price of product 1?:")
quantity_product_1=input("what quantity of product 1 will you buy?:")
price_product_2=input("what is the price of product 2?:")
quantity_product_2=input("what quantity of product 1 will you buy?:")
price_product_3=input("what is the price of product 1?:")
quantity_product_3=input("what quantity of product 1 will you buy?:")

result_product_1=float(price_product_1)*float(quantity_product_1)
result_product_2=float(price_product_2)*float(quantity_product_2)
result_product_3=float(price_product_3)*float(quantity_product_3)


result=result_product_1+result_product_2+result_product_3

print("your final price is "+str(result))




Practice 2

name_1=input("what is your name?: ")
name_2=input("what is your name?: ")
name_3=input("what is your name?: ")

slices_in_the_pizza=input("how many slices are there in the pizza?:")
price_paid_for_pizza=input("what was the price of the pizza?:")

percentage_eaten_person_1=input(name_1+" what percentage did you eat of the pizza?: ")
percentage_eaten_person_2=input(name_2+" what percentage did you eat of the pizza?: ")
percentage_eaten_person_3=input(name_3+" what percentage did you eat of the pizza?: ")

number_of_slices_person_1=float(percentage_eaten_person_1)*float(slices_in_the_pizza)
number_of_slices_person_2=float(percentage_eaten_person_2)*float(slices_in_the_pizza)
number_of_slices_person_3=float(percentage_eaten_person_3)*float(slices_in_the_pizza)

price_paid_name_1=float(percentage_eaten_person_1)*float(price_paid_for_pizza)
price_paid_name_2=float(percentage_eaten_person_2)*float(price_paid_for_pizza)
price_paid_name_3=float(percentage_eaten_person_3)*float(price_paid_for_pizza)


print(name_1+"  has eaten  "+str(number_of_slices_person_1)+"   slices and has paid  "+str(price_paid_name_1)+"$ for his meal")
print(name_2+"  has eaten  "+str(number_of_slices_person_2)+"   slices and has paid  "+str(price_paid_name_2)+"$ for his meal")
print(name_3+"  has eaten  "+str(number_of_slices_person_3)+"   slices and has paid  "+str(price_paid_name_3)+"$ for his meal")




SECTION 3


Comments
print("something")                      #this will print the word 'something'
#this is an additional comment and will not show when you run the app


Functions

def love(name):
    print("I love " +name)

love("pizza")



you can write the parameters yourself or get the user to input them  using the input function




def pers_1(name):
    print(name + ": hello how can I help you?")

def pers2_1(food, drink, dessert, name):
    name=input("what is your name?")
    food=input("what food do you want to eat?")
    drink=input("what do you want to drink?")
    dessert=input("what do you want for dessert?")
    print(name+ ": I would like "+ food+", I want to drink "+ drink+", I want "+ dessert+" as a dessert")

def pers_1_2(name):
    print(name+ " : thank you")

pers_1("cashier")
pers2_1("food", "drink", "dessert", "name")
pers_1_2("cashier")




remember functions allow you to store calculations, variables, strings, boolean, numbers - use them for anything





HOW TO USE THE RETURN STATEMENT

it is a statement that is used to end a certain function 



def calculation(a,b,c):
    print(a+b+c)
    print("this is a calculation")
    return print(a-b-c)
    print(a*b/c)

calculation(1,2,3)

IF STATEMENTS ARE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF PYTHON






LISTS


variable_1= "apple"
list_1=["apple", "banana","pineapple", "melon"]      <---- this is called a Python Index


print(list_1[3])


variable_1= "apple"
list_1=["apple", "banana","pineapple", "melon", "strawberry", "other"]
list_1[3]="avocado"
list_1[2]="tomato"
print(list_1)


variable_1= "apple"
list_1=["apple", "banana","pineapple", "melon", "strawberry", "other"]

print(list_1[0:6])   <----- prints the full list of items from 0-6 (remember 0 exists as part of the list and would be 'apple' here)


A VARIABLE ONLY HAS 1 ELEMENT IN IT (COULD BE BOOLEAN, STRING, NUMBER)
IN A LIST YOU CAN HAVE NUMBERS, BOOLEAN, STRINGS


variable_1= "apple"
list_1=["apple", "banana","pineapple", "melon", "strawberry", "other"]

print(list_1[2:])



USING FUNCTIONS WITH LISTS



food=["hamburger", "pizza", "juice", "fries", "sushi"]

prices=[5.66, 3.92, 7.29, 4.95, 3.20]

food.insert(2,"spaghetti")

food.extend(prices)



print(food)





food=["hamburger", "pizza", "juice", "fries", "sushi", "pizza", "pizza", "juice", "juice", "hamburger"]

prices=[5.66, 3.92, 7.29, 4.95, 3.20]

food.insert(2,"spaghetti")


print(food.count("pizza"))


IF YOU USE CAPITAL LETTERS IT WON'T COUNT TGHE NUMBER FOR YOU



food=["hamburger", "pizza", "juice", "fries", "sushi", "pizza", "pizza", "juice", "juice", "hamburger", "sushi"]

prices=[5.66, 3.92, 7.29, 4.95, 3.20]

food.insert(2,"spaghetti")

random=food.copy()+prices.copy()
print(random)



DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LISTS & TUPLES

list=["red", "blue", "yellow"]

list.insert(2, "pink")

print(list)




 LISTS SHOULD BE USED FOR VARIABLES, TUPLES FOR COORDINATES / IP ADDRESSES WHICH DON'T CHANGE 


colours=("blue", "yellow", "red")


shapes=("square", "triangle", "circle")


list=colours+shapes

print(list)






colours=("blue", "yellow", "red")


shapes=("square", "triangle", "circle")


list=colours+shapes

paris_coord=(135, 156)

print(list)





DICTIONARIES IN PYTHON




ONE WORD LINKED WITH MANY WORDS 

DICTIONARIES IN PYTHON CAN STORE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA, COULD BE STRINGS/NUMBERS 
YOU CAN STORE A NUMBER WITH A STRING AND VICA VERSA


colours={   "B" : "blue",
            "R" : "red",
            "o" : "orange"

}


print(colours.get("o", "stop"))



THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF A DICTIONARY IN  PYTHON



names={    152: "name_A",
           254: "name_B",
           524: "name_C",
           754: "name_D"


}


print(names.get(524, "This name doesn't exist"))




UNDERSTANDING WHILE LOOPS


variable_1=25
variable_2=2000

while variable_1<variable_2:
    print(variable_1)
    print("not good")

THIS ONE JUST KEEPS PRINTING 25 + not good


variable_1=25
variable_2=2000

while variable_1<variable_2:
    print(variable_1)
    print("not good")
    variable_1=variable_1+5


THIS ONE PRINTS ALL NUMBERS FROM 25 + 5 AN INFINITUM UNTIL 2000 (S0 HERE UNTIL 1995)





UNDERSTANDING FOR LOOPS



colors=["blue", "red", "orange", "black"]

for one_color in colors:
    print(one_color)




for letter in "blue":
    print(letter)






colors=["black", "yellow", "green", "red"]
for one_color in colors:
    print(one_color)
    if one_color=="red":
        break



for number in range(20, 30):
    print(number)



CREATING AND BLOCKING PASSWORDS


our_password="pass123"
your_answer=""
number_of_tries=0
number_of_max_tries=8
max_tries="not reached"

while your_answer!=our_password and max_tries!="reached":
    if number_of_tries<number_of_max_tries:
        your_answer=input("what is the password")
        number_of_tries=number_of_tries+1
    else:
        max_tries="reached"

if max_tries=="reached":
    print("account blocked")
else:
    print("access granted")

THIS ALLOWS USER TO ENTER 8 PASSWORDS WHICH THEN BLOCKS ANY MORE INPUTS, IF IT IS CORRECTLY ENTERED IT CONFIRMS BY SAYING "access granted"







TESTING COMBINATIONS WITH LOOPS

MEALS/DRINKS/DESSERTS AND USE THE FOR LOOP


A NESTED LOOP = A LOOP WITHIN A LOOP


meal=["pizza", "burger", "spaghetti"]
drink=["water", "juice", "cordial"]
dessert=["cake", "ice cream", "cupcakes"]


for m in meal:
    for d in drink:
        for ds in dessert:
            print("I will have " +m+ " as a meal " + "I also want " +d+ " as a drink and " +ds+ " as a dessert")








CREATION OF A BASIC ENCRYPTION APP
